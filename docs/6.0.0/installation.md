There are multiple ways of installing Hydejack.
The easiest is [via the Ruby gem](#via-gem).
If you bought the "PRO" version of Hydejack or downloaded the zip, you'll want to install [via the zip file](#via-zip).
If you know what you are doing, you can [fork or clone the git repository](#via-git).

## Via gem
Installation via the gem-based theme has the advantage of not cluttering your blog repository, so it is especially recommended for beginners.

If you haven't already, create a new Jekyll site first:

    $ jekyll new <PATH>

Your blog directory should look something like this

~~~
├── _posts
│   └── 2017-04-07-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
├── _config.yml
├── about.md
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
└── index.md
~~~

Next, you'll want to add `jekyll-theme-hydejack` as a dependency by adding the following line to the `Gemfile`.

~~~ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-hydejack"
~~~

Now you want to edit the `_config.yml` of your Jekyll site and set Hydejack as the theme.
Look for the `theme` key (or add it when missing) and set its value to `jekyll-theme-hydejack`.

~~~
theme: jekyll-theme-hydejack
~~~

The dependencies will be fetched from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) when running Jekyll via [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

You can now point your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and see Hydejack in action.

**NOTE**: If you are missing the `bundle` command, you can install Bundler by running `gem install bundler`.

For more information on gem-based themes, see the [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).

## Via zip
If you downloaded the zip, the folder structure will look like:

~~~
├── _data
├── _featured_categories
├── _featured_tags
├── _includes
│   ├── scripts
│   └── styles
├── _js
│   ├── lib
│   └── src
│       └── flip
├── _layouts
├── _posts
├── _sass
│   ├── hydejack
│   └── pooleparty
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   ├── icomoon
│   ├── img
│   └── js
├── docs
│   └── 6.0.0
├── _config.yml
├── 404.md
├── about.md
├── index.html
└── posts.md
~~~

The dependencies will be fetched from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) when running Jekyll via [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

**NOTE**: If you are missing the `bundle` command, you can install Bundler by running `gem install bundler`.

### Without Bundler
If you do not want to use Bundler, you can install the dependencies yourself via `gem install <dep>`. They are

- `jekyll`
- `jekyll-paginate`
- `jekyll-feed`
- `jekyll-sitemap`

## Via git
If you are familiar with using git, you can add the [Hydejack repository](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack) as a remote, and merge its master branch into your working branch.

    $ git remote add hydejack ...
    $ git merge hydejack/master

You can also update Hydejack this way. The master branch will not contain work in progress, but will contain major (breaking) releases.

If you are starting a new blog you can also fork or clone the repository and use it as basis, though it's debatable whether that's desirable.
