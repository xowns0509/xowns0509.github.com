## From Hydejack v5
Unfortunately, upgrading form v5 is not straightforward. A lot of patterns and names have changed, motivated by a variety of reasons, including better integration with the rest of the Jekyll ecosystem and simplified workflows enabled by Jekyll Collections.

### Updating the folder structure
Copy the the following folders and files from Hydejack v6 into your existing repository.
Make sure you merge the folder contents.

* `_data`
* `_includes`
* `_layouts`
* `_sass`
* `assets`
* `404.md`
* `index.html`

1. Delete the `public` folder. If you have placed files in the `public` folder, only delete `public/css`, `public/js` and `public/fonts` instead. Static files are now located in the `assets` folder.
1. Delete `404.html` (now provided by `404.md` and the `not-found` layout)


### Updating the configuration
`_config.yml` has changed considerably. Open it and make the following changes.

1.  Rename the following keys

    * `font_accent` => `font_heading`
    * `load_google_fonts` => `google_fonts`
    * `google_analytics_id` => `google_analytics`
    * `disqus` => `disqus_shortname`

1.  Enable Jekyll Collections by adding

    ~~~yml
    collections:
      featured_categories:
        permalink: /category/:name/
        output:    true
      featured_tags:
        permalink: /tag/:name/
        output:    true
      projects:
        permalink: /projects/:path/
        output:    true
    ~~~

1.  Copy the entire `author` hash (including the top-level `author` key) from `_config.yml` into the new file `_data/authors.yml` and add it to the top of the file (you can delete the rest of the file).
1.  In `_config.yml`, delete every key of the `author` hash except `name` and `email`.
1.  Choose a shortname and use it as the key for the author, e.g.

    ~~~yml
    qwtel:
      name:    Florian Klampfer
      email:   f.klampfer@gmail.com
      photo:   ...
      photo2x: ...
      about: |
        Hi, I'm Florian or `@qwtel`...
      social:
        twitter: qwtel
        github:  qwtel
    ~~~

You can take a look at the [full `authors.yml`](https://github.com/qwtel/hydejack/blob/v6/_data/authors.yml) for reference.

**NOTE**: When making changes to `_config.yml`, it is necessary to restart the Jekyll process for the changes to take effect.

### Updating the author
1.  Open `_data/authors.yml`
1.  Delete `photo` and `photo2x` form the author you've copied and add a `picture` hash instead that looks like

    ~~~yml
    picture:
      src: <photo>
      srcset:
        1x: <photo>
        2x: <photo2x>
    ~~~

    If you have only one photo, you can just provide the URL directly, e.g. `picture: <url>`.

For more information, see [Adding an author]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/6.0.0/configuration.md %}#adding-an-author).

### Restoring the tags
1.  Delete the `tag` folder.
2.  Create a top-level folder called `_featured_tags`.
3.  For each entry in `_data/tags.yml`, create a markdown file in `_features_tags` with the tag name as filename,
    e.g. `hyde.md`.
4.  For each tag, copy its contents from `_data/tags.yml` into the new file's front matter, e.g.

    ~~~yml
    ---
    name: Hyde
    image: /hydejack/public/img/hyde.jpg
    color: '#949667'
    description: >
      Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme...
    ---
    ~~~

5. Add `layout: list` to the front matter.
6. Once you've copied all tags into their own files, delete `_data/tags.yml`.

### Restoring the sidebar entries
Hydejack can now link to any kind of page in the sidebar.

1. Delete `sidebar_tags` in `_config.yml` as this key is no longer used.
2. Open a file who's page you would like to add to the sidebar. If you want to add a tag, open `_featured_tags/<tagname>.md`.
3. Add `menu: true` to its front matter.
4. (Optional) Set `order: <position>`, where `<position>` is the position at which you would like the link to appear.

### Restoring the RSS feed
The feed is now provided by the `jekyll-feed` plugin instead of a custom solution.

1.  Delete `atom.xml`
1.  Add `- jekyll-feed` to `gems` in `_config.yml`, e.g.

    ~~~yml
    gems:
      - jekyll-feed
      - jekyll-sitemap
      - jekyll-paginate
    ~~~

2.  Add the following to `_config.yml`:

    ~~~yml
    feed:
      path: atom.xml
    ~~~

### Restoring the comments
Hydejack now supports comments on every page. However, you have to enable them per page by adding `comments: true` to the front matter (shold you have followed the [Disqus integration guide](https://disqus.com/admin/install/platforms/jekyll/), this should be familiar).

As mentioned above, don't forget to rename `disqus` to `disqus_shortname` in `_config.yml`.

### Restoring the about page
Hydejack now has a dedicated layout for about pages.
To use it, open `about.md` and change the `layout` in the front matter to `about` and delete `{\% include about-short.html author=site.author %\}`.

## From free to "PRO" version*
Upgrading form the free version to "PRO" is straightforward. All that is necessary to copy the following folders from "PRO" into your repository.

* `_includes`
* `_layouts`
* `_sass`
* `assets`

Since you've probably added files to some of these folders, make sure you merge the contents.
If you've modified any files (discouraged) the changes will be overwritten and you have to redo those changes.

If you'd like to add examples of the new layouts, you can additionally copy:

* `projects.md`
* `resume.md`
* `welcome.md`
